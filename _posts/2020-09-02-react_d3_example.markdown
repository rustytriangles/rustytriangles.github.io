For something I'm working on, I needed to figure out how to create a [React](https://reactjs.org/) app that uses [D3](https://d3js.org/) and deploys to a github page.
I couldn't find a good example that had all of those pieces together, so I did a bit of hacking and came up with [this](https://github.com/rustytriangles/payems-chart).
That creates a simple line chart using employment data from [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/). A simple `npm run deploy` will push it to [this github page](https://rustytriangles.github.io/payems-chart/).
