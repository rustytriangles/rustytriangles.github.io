If you're anything like me, as soon as you saw the patterns [I was talkinga about yesterday](https://rustytriangles.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/09/29/gaussian-primes.html)
in the Gaussian primes, you wanted to know whether there were similar patterns in the
[Eisenstein primes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisenstein_prime). So I made [this](https://github.com/rustytriangles/eisenstein_primes) to find out.

The answer is yes. And I think they're even cooler, just because they look like snowflakes.

I deployed it to [this github page](https://rustytriangles.github.io/eisenstein_primes/) so you can play with it too.
