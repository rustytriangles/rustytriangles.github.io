I was reading Roger Penrose's old Pentaplexity paper recently. It's about the history of
his famous nonperiodic tile set. But I was particularly struck by one of the diagrams
showing how he started by subdividing pentagons recursively. I wanted an interactive
version to play with, so I made [this](https://github.com/rustytriangles/recursive_pentagons).
You can play with it [here on github pages](https://rustytriangles.github.io/recursive_pentagons/).
