I've been spending some time with [React](https://reactjs.org/) lately.
Naturally, that meant that I needed to do another teapot.
I found the [React Three Fiber project](https://github.com/react-spring/react-three-fiber) which
provides a react renderer that makes it really easy to plug [three.js](https://threejs.org/) content
into a React app. So I used that to make [this github page](https://rustytriangles.github.io/r3f-teapot/).
You can find the [source here](https://github.com/rustytriangles/r3f-teapot), but it could really use a cleanup pass.
