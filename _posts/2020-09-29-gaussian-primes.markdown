John D Cook recently had [a post](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2020/09/24/gaussian_integer_walk/)
on [his blog](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/) about a [Stack Overflow thread](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/91423/gaussian-prime-spirals)
about some interesting patterns in the Gaussian primes. I had gotten really interested in Gaussian
primes after reading [Martin Weissman's wonderful book](http://illustratedtheoryofnumbers.com/), so
I knew I needed to make an interactive toy to play with the patterns. Since I'd just been doing
[this project](https://rustytriangles.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/09/22/tile_explorer.html) in
SVG & React, I used those. The result is [here](https://github.com/rustytriangles/gaussian_primes). I also
deployed it to [this github page](https://rustytriangles.github.io/gaussian_primes/) so you can play with it too.
